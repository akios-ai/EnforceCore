# Legal Disclaimer

## No Warranty

EnforceCore is provided **"AS IS"**, without warranty of any kind, express or
implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability,
fitness for a particular purpose, and noninfringement.

In no event shall the authors, copyright holders, or contributors be liable
for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract,
tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the software
or the use or other dealings in the software.

## Not a Compliance Certification

EnforceCore is a **technical tool** that provides runtime enforcement
capabilities for agentic AI systems. It is **not** a compliance certification,
legal guarantee, or regulatory approval.

Specifically:

- **Using EnforceCore does not guarantee compliance** with the EU AI Act,
  GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA, SOC 2, ISO 27001, or any other regulatory framework.
- **EnforceCore does not provide legal advice.** Always consult qualified
  legal counsel for compliance requirements specific to your jurisdiction and
  use case.
- **Policy correctness is the user's responsibility.** EnforceCore enforces
  the policies you define — if your policies are incomplete or incorrect,
  enforcement will reflect that.
- **No guarantee of security.** While EnforceCore is designed to fail closed
  and enforce policies at the runtime boundary, no software can guarantee
  absolute security. Defense in depth is always recommended.

## Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall
AKIOUD AI, SAS, its contributors, or affiliates be liable for:

1. Any **indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages**,
   including but not limited to loss of profits, data, business opportunities,
   or goodwill.
2. Any **damages arising from the use or inability to use** EnforceCore,
   even if advised of the possibility of such damages.
3. Any **damages resulting from unauthorized access** to or alteration of
   your data or transmissions.
4. Any **damages resulting from the actions of AI agents** that use or fail
   to use EnforceCore's enforcement mechanisms.

## Intended Use

EnforceCore is intended to be used as **one layer** in a defense-in-depth
security strategy for agentic AI systems. It should be used alongside — not
instead of — other security measures including but not limited to:

- Network-level security controls
- Authentication and authorization systems
- Input validation and sanitization
- Monitoring and alerting systems
- Human oversight and review processes
- Regular security audits

## PII Redaction Disclaimer

The PII redaction capabilities in EnforceCore are provided on a **best-effort
basis**. No PII detection system achieves
100% accuracy. Specifically:

- **False negatives** (missed PII) may occur. Do not rely solely on
  EnforceCore for PII protection in regulated environments.
- **False positives** (non-PII flagged as PII) may occur, potentially
  affecting the functionality of enforced tool calls.
- PII detection accuracy varies by language, format, and context.

## Audit Trail Disclaimer

The Merkle-tree audit trail provides **cryptographic integrity verification**
for audit entries generated by EnforceCore. However:

- Audit trails only record events that pass through EnforceCore's enforcement
  points. Activity outside of enforced calls is not captured.
- The integrity of audit trails depends on the security of the underlying
  storage system. Use `Auditor(immutable=True)` for OS-enforced append-only
  protection and `Auditor(witness=...)` for external hash witnessing to
  strengthen tamper evidence.
- Audit trails are not a substitute for comprehensive system logging and
  monitoring.

## Open Source License

EnforceCore is licensed under the [Apache License 2.0](LICENSE). This license
includes its own limitation of liability and disclaimer of warranties in
Sections 7 and 8, which are incorporated here by reference.

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability in EnforceCore, please report it
responsibly by emailing **security@akios.ai**. Do not open a public GitHub
issue for security vulnerabilities.
